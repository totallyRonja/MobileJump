Code test game I made in 3 days.

Theres a few corners where I'm not entirely happy with the architecture, 
but considering the development time and that I made everything that isnt Unity in the game myself 
(with the exception of the SDF toolkit for asset generation and the fire emoji) - I'd say this is pretty good :)
