Code test game I made in 3 days.

Theres a few corners where I'm not entirely happy with the architecture, 
but considering the development time and that I made everything that isnt Unity in the game myself 
(with the exception of the SDF toolkit for asset generation and the fire emoji) - I'd say this is pretty good :)

Mouse click in the editor works when you enable touch simulation but theres a bug in that from the Unity side currectly that throws some errors, I decided to ignore that right now.
